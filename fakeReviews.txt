"This bathroom is mad nasty, yo! Pissy and rancid with doo-doo stains everywhere! You're better off popping a squat in the woods, for real.",
"It's what you expect from a public restroom. Nothing to write home about.",
"This restroom is very clean and always well stocked.",
"This ain't no bathroom. This a damn poo room!"
"One of the safest public restrooms in the area, by far. Very well lit and clean. I like that each stall is its on individual room with a locking door.",
"Oh my God, talk about luxurious! Everything is gilded, there's an attendant, and all the toilets have bidets! If you've never used a bidet,
it feels like a million angels spitting on your butthole.",
"You should only use this restroom if you hate yourself. Everything is broken, and it's almost never clean.",
"Two words: glory holes."
